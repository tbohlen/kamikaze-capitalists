# Kamikaze Capitalists

CMS.611/6.073, Fall 2012
MIT Game Lab

### Vision: 

Kamikaze Capitalists is a competitive real-time city building game where two
players fight on a single board to take out their enemy’s capital. This should
be a 5-10 minute game, and very strategic, rather than random.

### Goal:

This project is just for 6.073/CMS.611 and will be built for a pc, rather than
tablet or smartphone.
Time/Responsibility Breakdown:

__We need:__
Programmers
Producer
Visual Art Director
Music Director

__People and Commitments:__
_Daniel_: Producer. 6 hours a week
_Todd_: Programming. 6 hours a week
_Wei Wei_: Music/Visual Art/Programming. 6 hours a week
_Turner_: Visual Art/Programming. 6 hours a week, busy the second week
_Jeremy_: Programming. 6 hours a week

### One Minute of Gameplay:

The player moves their cursor around, building and destroying building as
restricted by a move timer. On regular intervals, as their older building
degrade, the player has to shift focus from offense to maintenance. Play is
fast paced, so that the player cannot devote too much time to thinking.

### Major Gameplay Concepts:

Like in an RTS game, expanding a physical base and expanding toward the enemy
in preparation for an attack must be balanced.

The only way to attack is by sacrificing your own buildings, which makes attack
costly.

### Risks:

The biggest risk here is that real-time doesn’t work with this game and we have
to return to a turn based game.

Another big potential issue is rendering the game board in such a way that both
players can see all the buildings on the board simultaneously, or,
alternatively, allowing the players to manipulate the board collaboratively.
